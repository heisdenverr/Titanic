## Prediction

The [gender_submission.csv](https://github.com/heisdenverr/Titanic/blob/master-branch/titanic/gender_submission.csv)
and [sample_submission.csv](https://github.com/heisdenverr/Titanic/blob/master-branch/titanic/sample_submission.csv) are the true predictions and hypothesis predictions respectively.


It's obvious My model is okay but It's still not predicting features correctly
But how can I fix that, I need to tune hyper parameters, use another Ml algorithms and learning model
